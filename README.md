# ERM-with-CNN
A basic neural network for emotion recognition for a university project. The combined dataset FER2013 and Emotion Detection was used.
The proposed CNN model is based on the trained MobileNetV2 image classification model. This is a model that was developed by Google and is open for use. MobileNetV2 can achieve high classification accuracy using much fewer parameters and computing resources than traditional CNNs. The model is used not only for image classification, but also for face and gesture recognition. The table shows a comparison of basic facial emotion recognition models with and without MobileNetV2 (which takes on the task of classification).
